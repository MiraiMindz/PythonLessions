once a philosopher named mirai told me that programming was the same as human speech, once learned you can pick up other languages ​​and you will need to learn the syntax of the new language, but something will never change and this thing is "you can already speak :)".

programming is about solving problems as well as being made up of a lot of context

Python is a high-level, scripting, imperative, object-oriented, functional, dynamically typed, and strong programming language.

------programming pillars-----
(logic, documentation, design)
